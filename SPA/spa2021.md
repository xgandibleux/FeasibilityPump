There are currently 49 data files.


## Format
The format is originally from the [OR library](http://people.brunel.ac.uk/~mastjjb/jeb/orlib/sppinfo.html) extended for handling multiple objectives.

The format of all of these data files is:

    number of rows (m), number of columns (n)   
    for each column j (j=1,...,n) in turn:    
        column cost for objective 1 c1(j)
        column cost for objective 2 c2(j)
        number of rows covered by j
        list of the rows covered by j


## Instances:

The data files are:
+    biodidactic
+    biosppaa01, biosppaa02, biosppaa03, biosppaa05
+    biosppnw01, biosppnw02, ... , biosppnw43
+    biorail4284

For these instances, the coefficients of the second objective are a random permutation of the coefficients of the first objective.
